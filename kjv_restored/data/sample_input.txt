For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Jesus Christ is the Lord and Messiah. The Holy Spirit guides us in all truth.

Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
